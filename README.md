## Introduction
  - The goal of this project was to create a Next.js application that displays the foundational features of Next.js (server-side rendering, routing with the pages folder, etc).
  - Visit NYT-reader to see a list of the top three stories from the NYT Top Stories API. The user can click the title of each article to be taken to the article on the NYT mothership. The user can also select a topic from a nav bar to see the top four stories of their chosen topic with the same functionality as the homepage articles.
  
## Technologies
  - Next.js
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- See the top NYT articles from, at first, the home section.
- Choose a topic to see the top 4 articles in that topic.
- Click the title of any article to be taken to the article on the NYT website.

## Possible Future Extensions
- Replace the link to the NYT article with a link to a new component that offers more contextual info on the article (abstract, etc.) which includes the external link. That way the user will be able to know more before navigating away.

## Set Up
